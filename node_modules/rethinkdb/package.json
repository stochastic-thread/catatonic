  "readme": "# JavaScript Driver\n\nThis package is the officially supported driver for querying a\nRethinkDB database from a JavaScript application.  It is designed to\nbe run in Node.js but also has an alternate http connection type that\nis used by the RethinkDB web ui.  The http connection type is not\nintended to be used by applications, since it isn't secure.\nUltimately, the http connection type will move into the web ui code\nand out of the driver.\n\nCheck out\n[rethinkdb.com/api/javascript](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript)\nfor documentation and examples of using this driver.\n\n## Creating the proto-def.js\n\nTo build the JavaScript driver, you'll need to first generate the\ndefinitions file `proto-def.js`. To do that from the `drivers`\ndirectory, you can do:\n\n```bash\n$ ./convert_protofile -l javascript \\\n   -i ../src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto \\\n   -o ./javascript/proto-def.js\n```\n",
